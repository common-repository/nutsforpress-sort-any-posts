NutsForPress Sort Any Posts is a simple and lightweight plugin that allows you to sort any kind of posts and show them in the order you've decided.


== Description ==

*Sort Any Posts* is one of the several NutsForPress plugins providing some essential features that WordPress does not offer itself or offers only partially.  

*Sort Any Posts* allows you to:

* decide which post or custom post should be orderable
* set the order by dragging and dropping post elements into the "sort" page added to the post or post type admin menu
* get the posts ordered in frontend, into your blog, your category or archive page

Sort Any Posts is full compliant with WPML (you don't need to translate any option value)
